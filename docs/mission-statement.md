The Canadian Experimental Film Preservation Archive (CEFPA) is a student-led digital archive focused on Canadian experimental and independent cinema.

The goal of the archive is to practice cataloging, metadata design, and digital preservation skills while documenting important works in Canadian film history. The project is inspired by professional library and museum archives but is designed as an educational learning archive.

CEFPA prioritizes accessibility, research value, and clear documentation.
