The Canadian Experimental Film Preservation Archive is a digital initiative dedicated to documenting and preserving Canadian experimental and independent moving image works.

The archive prioritizes underrepresented media forms, emerging filmmakers, and fragile digital works. It applies professional metadata standards and preservation workflows inspired by institutional archival practices to support accessibility, research, and cultural memory.
