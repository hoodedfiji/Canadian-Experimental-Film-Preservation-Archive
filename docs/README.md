# Canadian Experimental Film Preservation Archive (CEFPA)

The Canadian Experimental Film Preservation Archive (CEFPA) is a digital preservation and cataloging project focused on Canadian experimental and independent moving image works, with a special emphasis on the Toronto New Wave and Queen Street cinema scene.
