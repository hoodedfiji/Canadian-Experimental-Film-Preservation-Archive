# Preservation Policy

CEFPA is an educational archive and does not store film files. It catalogs metadata only.

The preservation goal of this project is to:

- document Canadian film history
- practice archival cataloging workflows
- simulate preservation thinking
- explore metadata standards

This archive functions as a research and learning tool, not a physical film repository.
