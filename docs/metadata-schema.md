CEFPA uses a simplified metadata structure inspired by Dublin Core.

Each catalog record includes:

- Identifier — unique archive ID number
- Title — film title
- Creator — director or filmmaker
- Year — year of release
- Format — film, video, or animation
- Notes — short description or historical context

This schema is intentionally simple to support learning and experimentation.
Additional preservation metadata may be added in future versions.
